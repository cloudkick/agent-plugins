Cloudkick Varnish plugin

Source released under the MIT license.

Description:

This plugin will pipe all output from the command "varnishstat -1"
up to Cloudkick.  In addition, it will store the cache_hit and cache_miss stats
in a tmp file on each execution so that it can compute a hit_rate stat, which will
also be reported to Cloudkick.

Error reporting:

This plugin will report an error only if varnishstat fails to
execute (generally this would only be the case if Varnish is not running).

Warn reporting:

This plugin will report a warning anytime that it fails to parse
varnishstat's output.

TODO:

Support custom warnings and errors when the hit_rate stat falls below a
specified threshold.
